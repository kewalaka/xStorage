# Description

The resource is used to set the drive letter of an optical disk drive (e.g. a
 CDROM or DVD drive).

It is designed to ignore 'temporary' optical disk drives that are created when
mounting ISOs on Windows Server 2012+.

With the Device ID, we look for the length of the string after the final
backslash (crude, but appears to work so far).

Example:
    # DeviceID for a virtual drive in a Hyper-V VM
        SCSI\CDROM&VEN_MSFT&PROD_VIRTUAL_DVD-ROM\**000006**

    # DeviceID for a mounted ISO   in a Hyper-V VM
        SCSI\CDROM&VEN_MSFT&PROD_VIRTUAL_DVD-ROM\**2&1F4ADFFE&0&000002**
