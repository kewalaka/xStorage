# xStorage

The **xStorage** module contains the following resources:

- **xMountImage**: used to mount or unmount an ISO/VHD disk image. It can be
    mounted as read-only (ISO, VHD, VHDx) or read/write (VHD, VHDx).
- **xDisk**: used to initialize, format and mount the partition as a drive letter.
- **xDiskAccessPath**: used to initialize, format and mount the partition to a
    folder access path.
- **xOpticalDiskDriveLetter**: used to change the drive letter of an optical disk drive (e.g. a CDROM or DVD drive).
    This resource ignores mounted ISOs.
- **xWaitForDisk** wait for a disk to become available.
- **xWaitForVolume** wait for a drive to be mounted and become available.
